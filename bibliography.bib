abstract = {A method is presented for automated best-matching alignment of three-dimensional models represented by ensembles of points. A normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) is introduced as a proximity measure between three-dimensional objects. Starting from an inertia-axes alignment, the algorithm minimizes the NSD; the final value of the NSD provides a quantitative estimate of similarity between the objects. The method is implemented in a computer program. Simulations have been performed to test its performance on model structures with specified numbers of points ranging from a few to a few thousand. The method can be used for comparative analysis of structural models obtained by different methods, {\it e.g.} of high-resolution crystallographic atomic structures and low-resolution models from solution scattering or electron microscopy.},

A procedure is described to analyze multiple solutions provided by bead modeling methods and to estimate stability and reliability of the shape reconstruction. It is demonstrated that flat shapes are more difficult to restore than elongated ones and types of shapes are indicated, which require additional information for reliable shape reconsrtuction from the scattering data.},

The program was fully rewritten, and its algorithm was optimized for speed of execution and modified to avoid limitations due to the finite search volume. Symmetry and anisometry constraints can be imposed on the particle shape, similar to {\it DAMMIN}. In equivalent conditions, {\it DAMMIF} is 25{--}40 times faster than {\it DAMMIN} on a single CPU. The possibility to utilize multiple CPUs is added to {\it DAMMIF}. The application is available in binary form for major platforms.},

  abstract={2D area detectors like CCD or pixel detectors have become popular in the last 15 years for diffraction experiments (e.g. for WAXS, SAXS, single crystal and powder diffraction (XRPD)). These detectors have a large sensitive area of millions of pixels with high spatial resolution. The software package pyFAI has been designed to reduce SAXS, WAXS and XRPD images taken with those detectors into 1 D curves (azimuthal integration) usable by other software for in-depth analysis such as Rietveld refinement, or 2 D images (a radial transformation named caking ). As a library, the aim of pyFAI is to be integrated into other tools like PyMca or EDNA with a clean pythonic interface. However pyFAI features also command line tools for batch processing, converting data into q-space (q being the momentum transfer) or 2 ? -space ( ? being the Bragg angle) and a calibration graphical interface for optimizing the geometry of the experiment using the Debye-Scherrer rings of a reference sample. PyFAI shares the geometry definition of SPD but can directly import geometries determined by the software FIT2D. PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector and geometry (transmission or reflection) and relies on FabIO, a library able to read more than 20 image formats produced by detectors from 12 different manufacturers. During the transformation from cartesian space (x,y) to polar space (2?, ?), both local and total intensities are conserved in order to obtain accurate quantitative results. Technical details on how this integration is implemented and how it has been ported to native code and parallelized on graphic cards are discussed in this paper.}
